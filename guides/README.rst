Guides for Hypothesis Development
=================================

This is a general collection of useful documentation for people
working on Hypothesis.

It is separate from the main documentation because it is not much
use if you are merely *using* Hypothesis. It's purely for working
on it, and aimed more at maintainers than casual contributors.

Most of these are currently written with the Python version of
Hypothesis in mind, but will evolve over time to be more multilingual.
